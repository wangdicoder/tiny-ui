Most commonly\n * it's used to animate the mounting and unmounting of a component, but can also\n * be used to describe in-place transition states as well.\n *\n * ---\n *\n * **Note**: `Transition` is a platform-agnostic base component. If you're using\n * transitions in CSS, you'll probably want to use\n * [`CSSTransition`](https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/css-transition)\n * instead. It inherits all the features of `Transition`, but contains\n * additional features necessary to play nice with CSS transitions (hence the\n * name of the component).\n *\n * ---\n *\n * By default the `Transition` component does not alter the behavior of the\n * component it renders, it only tracks \"enter\" and \"exit\" states for the\n * components. It's up to you to give meaning and effect to those states. For\n * example we can add styles to a component when it enters or exits:\n *\n * ```jsx\n * import { Transition } from 'react-transition-group';\n *\n * const duration = 300;\n *\n * const defaultStyle = {\n *   transition: `opacity ${duration}ms ease-in-out`,\n *   opacity: 0,\n * }\n *\n * const transitionStyles = {\n *   entering: { opacity: 1 },\n *   entered:  { opacity: 1 },\n *   exiting:  { opacity: 0 },\n *   exited:  { opacity: 0 },\n * };\n *\n * const Fade = ({ in: inProp }) => (\n *   <Transition in={inProp} timeout={duration}>\n *     {state => (\n *       <div style={{\n *         ...defaultStyle,\n *         ...transitionStyles[state]\n *       }}>\n *         I'm a fade Transition!\n *       </div>\n *     )}\n *   </Transition>\n * );\n * ```\n *\n * There are 4 main states a Transition can be in:\n *  - `'entering'`\n *  - `'entered'`\n *  - `'exiting'`\n *  - `'exited'`\n *\n * Transition state is toggled via the `in` prop. When `true` the component\n * begins the \"Enter\" stage. During this stage, the component will shift from\n * its current transition state, to `'entering'` for the duration of the\n * transition and then to the `'entered'` stage once it's complete. Let's take\n * the following example (we'll use the\n * [useState](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usestate) hook):\n *\n * ```jsx\n * function App() {\n *   const [inProp, setInProp] = useState(false);\n *   return (\n *     <div>\n *       <Transition in={inProp} timeout={500}>\n *         {state => (\n *           // ...\n *         )}\n *       </Transition>\n *       <button onClick={() => setInProp(true)}>\n *         Click to Enter\n *       </button>\n *     </div>\n *   );\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * When the button is clicked the component will shift to the `'entering'` state\n * and stay there for 500ms (the value of `timeout`) before it finally switches\n * to `'entered'`.\n *\n * When `in` is `false` the same thing happens except the state moves from\n * `'exiting'` to `'exited'`.\n */\n\nvar Transition = /*#__PURE__*/function (_React$Component) {\n  _inheritsLoose(Transition, _React$Component);\n\n  function Transition(props, context) {\n    var _this;\n\n    _this = _React$Component.call(this, props, context) || this;\n    var parentGroup = context; // In the context of a TransitionGroup all enters are really appears\n\n    var appear = parentGroup && !parentGroup.isMounting ? props.enter : props.appear;\n    var initialStatus;\n    _this.appearStatus = null;\n\n    if (props.in) {\n      if (appear) {\n        initialStatus = EXITED;\n        _this.appearStatus = ENTERING;\n      } else {\n        initialStatus = ENTERED;\n      }\n    } else {\n      if (props.unmountOnExit || props.mountOnEnter) {\n        initialStatus = UNMOUNTED;\n      } else {\n        initialStatus = EXITED;\n      }\n    }\n\n    _this.state = {\n      status: initialStatus\n    };\n    _this.nextCallback = null;\n    return _this;\n  }\n\n  Transition.getDerivedStateFromProps = function getDerivedStateFromProps(_ref, prevState) {\n    var nextIn = _ref.in;\n\n    if (nextIn && prevState.status === UNMOUNTED) {\n      return {\n        status: EXITED\n      };\n    }\n\n    return null;\n  } // getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps) {\n  //   let nextStatus = null\n  //   if (prevProps !== this.props) {\n  //     const { status } = this.state\n  //     if (this.props.in) {\n  //       if (status !== ENTERING && status !== ENTERED) {\n  //         nextStatus = ENTERING\n  //       }\n  //     } else {\n  //       if (status === ENTERING || status === ENTERED) {\n  //         nextStatus = EXITING\n  //       }\n  //     }\n  //   }\n  //   return { nextStatus }\n  // }\n  ;\n\n  var _proto = Transition.prototype;\n\n  _proto.componentDidMount = function componentDidMount() {\n    this.updateStatus(true, this.appearStatus);\n  };\n\n  _proto.componentDidUpdate = function componentDidUpdate(prevProps) {\n    var nextStatus = null;\n\n    if (prevProps !== this.props) {\n      var status = this.state.status;\n\n      if (this.props.in) {\n        if (status !== ENTERING && status !== ENTERED) {\n          nextStatus = ENTERING;\n        }\n      } else {\n        if (status === ENTERING || status === ENTERED) {\n          nextStatus = EXITING;\n        }\n      }\n    }\n\n    this.updateStatus(false, nextStatus);\n  };\n\n  _proto.componentWillUnmount = function componentWillUnmount() {\n    this.cancelNextCallback();\n  };\n\n  _proto.getTimeouts = function getTimeouts() {\n    var timeout = this.props.timeout;\n    var exit, enter, appear;\n    exit = enter = appear = timeout;\n\n    if (timeout != null && typeof timeout !== 'number') {\n      exit = timeout.exit;\n      enter = timeout.enter; // TODO: remove fallback for next major\n\n      appear = timeout.appear !== undefined ? timeout.appear : enter;\n    }\n\n    return {\n      exit: exit,\n      enter: enter,\n      appear: appear\n    };\n  };\n\n  _proto.updateStatus = function updateStatus(mounting, nextStatus) {\n    if (mounting === void 0) {\n      mounting = false;\n    }\n\n    if (nextStatus !== null) {\n      // nextStatus will always be ENTERING or EXITING.\n      this.cancelNextCallback();\n\n      if (nextStatus === ENTERING) {\n        this.performEnter(mounting);\n      } else {\n        this.performExit();\n      }\n    } else if (this.props.unmountOnExit && this.state.status === EXITED) {\n      this.setState({\n        status: UNMOUNTED\n      });\n    }\n  };\n\n  _proto.performEnter = function performEnter(mounting) {\n    var _this2 = this;\n\n    var enter = this.props.enter;\n    var appearing = this.context ? this.context.isMounting : mounting;\n\n    var _ref2 = this.props.nodeRef ?

It's built upon the\n * [`Transition`](https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/transition)\n * component, so it inherits all of its props.\n *\n * `CSSTransition` applies a pair of class names during the `appear`, `enter`,\n * and `exit` states of the transition. The first class is applied and then a\n * second `*-active` class in order to activate the CSS transition. After the\n * transition, matching `*-done` class names are applied to persist the\n * transition state.\n *\n * ```jsx\n * function App() {\n *   const [inProp, setInProp] = useState(false);\n *   return (\n *     <div>\n *       <CSSTransition in={inProp} timeout={200} classNames=\"my-node\">\n *         <div>\n *           {\"I'll receive my-node-* classes\"}\n *         </div>\n *       </CSSTransition>\n *       <button type=\"button\" onClick={() => setInProp(true)}>\n *         Click to Enter\n *       </button>\n *     </div>\n *   );\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * When the `in` prop is set to `true`, the child component will first receive\n * the class `example-enter`, then the `example-enter-active` will be added in\n * the next tick. `CSSTransition` [forces a\n * reflow](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group/blob/5007303e729a74be66a21c3e2205e4916821524b/src/CSSTransition.js#L208-L215)\n * between before adding the `example-enter-active`. This is an important trick\n * because it allows us to transition between `example-enter` and\n * `example-enter-active` even though they were added immediately one after\n * another. Most notably, this is what makes it possible for us to animate\n * _appearance_.\n *\n * ```css\n * .my-node-enter {\n *   opacity: 0;\n * }\n * .my-node-enter-active {\n *   opacity: 1;\n *   transition: opacity 200ms;\n * }\n * .my-node-exit {\n *   opacity: 1;\n * }\n * .my-node-exit-active {\n *   opacity: 0;\n *   transition: opacity 200ms;\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * `*-active` classes represent which styles you want to animate **to**, so it's\n * important to add `transition` declaration only to them, otherwise transitions\n * might not behave as intended! This might not be obvious when the transitions\n * are symmetrical, i.e. when `*-enter-active` is the same as `*-exit`, like in\n * the example above (minus `transition`), but it becomes apparent in more\n * complex transitions.\n *\n * **Note**: If you're using the\n * [`appear`](http://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/transition#Transition-prop-appear)\n * prop, make sure to define styles for `.appear-*` classes as well.\n */\n\n\nvar CSSTransition = /*#__PURE__*/function (_React$Component) {\n  _inheritsLoose(CSSTransition, _React$Component);\n\n  function CSSTransition() {\n    var _this;\n\n    for (var _len = arguments.length, args = new Array(_len), _key = 0; _key < _len; _key++) {\n      args[_key] = arguments[_key];\n    }\n\n    _this = _React$Component.call.apply(_React$Component, [this].concat(args)) || this;\n    _this.appliedClasses = {\n      appear: {},\n      enter: {},\n      exit: {}\n    };\n\n    _this.onEnter = function (maybeNode, maybeAppearing) {\n      var _this$resolveArgument = _this.resolveArguments(maybeNode, maybeAppearing),\n          node = _this$resolveArgument[0],\n          appearing = _this$resolveArgument[1];\n\n      _this.removeClasses(node, 'exit');\n\n      _this.addClass(node, appearing ?

This\n   *    allows you to define different behavior for when appearing is done and\n   *    when regular entering is done, using selectors like\n   *    `.fade-enter-done:not(.fade-appear-done)`.

classNames={{\n   *  appear: 'my-appear',\n   *  appearActive: 'my-active-appear',\n   *  appearDone: 'my-done-appear',\n   *  enter: 'my-enter',\n   *  enterActive: 'my-active-enter',\n   *

Modules:\n   *\n   * ```js\n   * import styles from './styles.css';\n   * ```\n   *\n   * you might want to use camelCase in your CSS file, that way could simply\n   * spread them instead of listing them one by one:\n   *\n   * ```js\n   * classNames={{ ...styles }}\n   * ```\n   *\n   * @type {string | {\n   *  appear?: string,\n   *  appearActive?: string,\n   *  appearDone?: string,\n   *
